Process:-> Process is a program in execution. It consist, memorySpace, <STACK and HEAP>

Threads:->LightWeight subprocess, Smallest unit of execution.

** IN JAVA (BY DEFAULT) all programming languages are sequential, they execute instruction one by one(on a line by line basis); 

** MultiThreading is the ability of CPU to execute multiple process, and threads simultaneously.

**Use <taskList> command to check how multi threading works in your CPU.

**TIME SLICING ALOGRITHM: It ensures that each task get a fair share of  the CPU's time by allowing each task to run for a fixed amount of time before moving on to next one.


** Benefit of MultiThreading:- 1) Execution of multiple tasks at a same time, make responsive application possible.
                            2)SAVE TIME

** Disadvantages of MultiThreading: 1)Using multithreading for short process do application complicated and take more time.

(ONLY a certain no. of threads is good , if they exceed then run time will also increase);



**THREAD LIFE CYCLE: 
1)New : When you intitalise threading
2)Active: when you runs start() method, runnable and running two states.
3)Blocked: When we use join() method then it waits to finish that thread.
4)Terminated: When thread finish the task.


**Sequential Processing is line by line execution of code.
